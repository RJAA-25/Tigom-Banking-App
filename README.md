# Tigom - Banking App
Avion School Project

Tigom is a simplified banking application which simulates the process of moving fictional digital funds (deposit, withdrawal, transfer) to and from your account.

An **Expense Tracker** feature is available for clients (end-users) which allows listing of expenses which may exceed one's current outstanding balance.

Only an admin account can process a fund deposit, but the rest of transaction types are available to everyone.

### Accounts

#### Admin Account
- Email: `admin@tigom.com.ph`
- Password: `tigom2022`

## Goals

This project is intended to apply React concepts learned from discussions into practice, such as *useState* and *useEffect*.

*localStorage* is also practiced to retain any updates and data manipulation after end of user session.
